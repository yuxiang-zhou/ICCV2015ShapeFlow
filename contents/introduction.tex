Building and training deformable models of objects (e.g. faces, ears, bodies, bottles, vehicles etc.) has recently been widely researched for object detection, part localisation, fitting, recognition and tracking using manual annotated data. Shapes and appearances of majority of objects vary significantly from object instance. To illustrate, ears have complicated inner structures (e.g. helix, crus antihelicis, scapha, tragus, lobe etc.) which differs remarkably between ears and highly sensitive to intensity changes. Recently, we have witnessed a great progress in object detection, alignment and recognition. 

To train deformable models with satisfiable generalisation, large amount of careful manual annotation is required. However, landmark annotation is extremely time consuming, work intensive and, most importantly, number of landmarks have to stay consistent for all training data while it is challenging to maintain the consistency or to avoid bias when annotating objects that having reach features. In ears, for example, large amount of landmarks required as the inner structure of ears are complex. To annotate an ear with clear contour, helix and cavum conchae, more than 50 landmarks are required. The inconsistency of ear features enhanced the difficulty of accurate annotation (e.g. Fossa Triangularies and Crus Helicis are optional feature of an ear also their visibility is highly sensitive to pose and illumination variation).
To illustrate how much time consuming careful ear annotation is, according to our experience, a trained annotator may need an average of (TODO: experiment) minutes per image for the manual annotation of 55 landmarks. This means that the annotation of 1000 images requires a total of about (TODO: experiment). Furthermore, personal issue, prior knowledge and circumstances can heavily bias the annotation accuracy thus second round correction might desired.

We propose a framework to (1) construct SDMs using training data with inconsistent annotation, (2) introduce highly effective curve annotation which tremendously reduces manual work overload but maintains same performance level against state-of-the-art SDMs and (3) build dense correspondent SDMs with shape flow. 

%(1)
Annotated data of same objects can have various number of landmarks, \cite{?} shown faces have landmarks different in range 10+ to 70+. Building SDMs (e.g. Active Appearance Models), however, require training data are annotated consistently, for example, all faces have 68 landmarks, 6 landmarks for an eye and 9 for a nose \cite{?}. Such property of SDMs largely limited their application area like combining different dataset as one. We propose the pipeline with non-rigid alignment and support vector shape to blend landmarks into relatively consistent shape discriminator before building models.

%(2)
Due to the fact that manual annotation is a rather costly and labour-intensive procedure, unsupervised and semi supervised learning of models for the tasks of alignment, landmark localization, tracking and recognition has attracted considerable attention \cite{?}. As our proposed framework are available to handle landmarks with inconsistency, it leads to a more efficient, convenient, unbiased and simple annotation methods - curve annotation. 

%(3)
To build dense correspondence between independent shapes, we apply optical flow on shapes with low rank constrains, so we name it shape flow. Optical flow is originally applied to video sequences that several assumptions holds, illumination consistency and motion smoothness, while shapes having no motion smoothness completely as all training data are independent. Low rank constrain plays important role to simulate motion smoothness assumption.

The two most closely related works to the proposed
method are the automatic construction of Active Appearance
Models (AAMs) in \cite{?} and the so-called RASL
methodology in \cite{?} for person-specific face alignment.
There are two main differences between our framework
and \cite{?}. (1) We use a predefined statistical shape model
instead of trying to find both the shape and appearance models.
We believe that with the current available optimization
techniques, it is extremely difficult to simultaneously optimize
for both the texture and shape parameters. (2) We
employ the robust component analysis of \cite{?} for the appearance
which deals with outliers. Thus, even though
our method is similar in concept to \cite{?}, these two differences
make the problem feasible to solve. In particular, the
methodology in \cite{?} fails to create a generic model even in
controlled recording conditions, due to extremely high dimensionality
of the parameters to be found and to the sensitivity
of the subspace method to outliers. This was probably
one of the reasons why the authors demonstrate very
limited and only person-specific experiments. Furthermore,
our methodology bypasses some of the limitations of \cite{?},
which requires the presence of only one low-rank subspace,
hence it has been shown to work only for the case of congealing
images of a single person. Finally, we argue that
in order for an automatically constructed AAM methodology
to be robust to both within-class and out-of-class outliers4,
which cannot be avoided in totally unsupervised setting
statistical component analysis techniques should be
employed \cite{?}. 

We summarize our contributions as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Constructing SDMs using training data with inconsistent annotation.
  \item Introduce highly effective curve annotation which tremendously reduces manual work overload but maintains same performance level against state-of-the-art SDMs.
  \item Building dense correspondent SDMs with shape flow
\end{itemize}

In our experiment, we show that building robust dense models trained with inconsistent annotation and trained with curve annotation improves performance of discriminative models trained on carefully annotated data including ears, faces, bottles, (cars ?) and bodies. Evaluation methods and choices are described in details.
